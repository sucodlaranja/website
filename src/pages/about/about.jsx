            I'm very passionate about coding, I entered software engineering
            because I wanted to develop video games but while i was learning
            with the course, I cultivated interest for distributed systems,
            security and web devoloping. I intend to make my master's degree
            on these subjects. At my <Link to="/portfolio">portfolio</Link> or
